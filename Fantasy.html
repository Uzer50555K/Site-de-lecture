        <h2>The cruel prince</h2>

            <p><b>Author: </b> Holly BLACK</p>
            <p><b>Rating: </b> 4.5/5</p>
            <p><b>Synopsis: </b>Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.

And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.

Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.

To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.

As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</p>
          <p><b>Review: </b>Still impossible to put down and I know what happens!! Gotta say, I'm glad I didn't reread this before reading The Stolen Heir because that one would have paled in comparison. Nothing quite like Jude & Cardan.</p>

<h2>The invisible life of addie larue</h2>
        <article>

<p><b>Author: </b> V.E Schwab</p>
            <p><b>Rating: </b> 4.2/5</p>
            <p><b>Synopsis: </b>France, 1714: in a moment of desperation, a young woman makes a Faustian bargain to live forever and is cursed to be forgotten by everyone she meets.

Thus begins the extraordinary life of Addie LaRue, and a dazzling adventure that will play out across centuries and continents, across history and art, as a young woman learns how far she will go to leave her mark on the world.

But everything changes when, after nearly 300 years, Addie stumbles across a young man in a hidden bookstore and he remembers her name.</p>
          <p><b>Review: </b>When a book traps your soul from beginning to end and beyond, keeping hold of a string to your heart even as you leave it behind, you know it deserves all the constellations in the night sky.
