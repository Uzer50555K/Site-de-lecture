            <p><b>Author: </b> Nicola Yoon</p>
            <p><b>Rating: </b> 4.5/5</p>
            <p><b>Synopsis: </b>The Sun Is Also a Star follows two teenagers in New York City, Natasha Kingsley and Daniel Bae. Natasha is an illegal immigrant from Jamaica living in Brooklyn who learns that her family will be deported. Daniel is the son of Korean immigrants living in Harlem. Daniel is a poet resisting his parents' dream of him becoming a doctor, and Natasha is science-minded.

Natasha seeks help from an immigration lawyer, who tells her he has an appointment later in the day, then visits a record store, where she meets Daniel, who is in the city before a college admissions interview. The two teenagers spend the next several hours together, during which time they frequently discuss love and destiny, concepts they have differing opinions on.

When the time arrives, they head to their respective appointments, where they learn both of them were slotted to meet the same person.</p>
          <p><b>Review: </b>Absolutely in love with this book. Iâ€™ve just completed it, and there are no words to describe how brilliant the author expressed eachs perspective. It really opened my eyes to a new perspective on ideas exhibited! I just keep thinking about the other books I read, but nothing compares. Stop whatever you are doing.. and read it!! Definitely worth your time!!

<h2>The song of Achilles</h2>

            <p><b>Author: </b> Madeline Miller</p>
            <p><b>Rating: </b> 4.9/5</p>
            <p><b>Synopsis: </b>Set during the Greek Heroic Age, it is a retelling of the Trojan War as told from the perspective of Patroclus. The novel follows Patroclus' relationship with Achilles, from their initial meeting to their exploits during the Trojan War, with focus on their romantic relationship.</p>
          <p><b>Review: </b>The Song of Achilles is hands-down one of the best, most well-written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Going into it, I will admit I was a little unsure of whether it would be something I enjoyed. But Madline Miller's way with words is truly something extraordinary. This book made me feel joy, innocence, love, pain, and almost every emotion in between. Given the premise of the book, I'm sure that it is not exactly everyone's cup of tea, but I do think the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus was so beautifully portrayed. My heart was absolutely broken by the end of it, but the final line of the book certainly takes the cake in terms of making the reader feel something. After only a few chapters, it was hard to put the book down, and when I reached the final few chapters I almost didn't want to keep reading solely because I knew it would be over and I'd never experience reading it for the first time again. Miller has very quickly become one of my favorite authors between this novel and Circe, and I cannot wait to get my hands on whatever she writes next.
